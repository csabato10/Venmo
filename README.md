The classic money sending app Venmo is a prominent app in the lives of many people. Venmo is a convenient way to send money from your account to your friends without you needing to have the same bank.

This app is made using **Swift** and **XCode**.

In the future, I would like to make it that when you send transactions it appears on the Home screen and the Profile screen.
Currently, the settings are not functional, so that is something I would like to add as well.

## Features

Home screen has a ScrollView that allows the user to see the transactions of friends and like messages.
The buttons at the bottom of every screen allow the user to change between the Home, Cards, Crypto, and Profile views.
The Profile view has the same ScrollView as the Home screen, but only showing Transactions from or to the user. 
There is also a working Transfer button that can be used to modify the total amount of money in the user's Venmo balance by transfering it to the user's bank account.

## How to Run

This project can be run using **XCode**.

## Collaborators

I would like to thank Alec Nipp for all the guidance and teaching me how to use Swift. I would also like to thank Sam Shi for helping me realize that there was no way I was going to be able to make the Focus Timer app I originally planned because I couldn't figure out how put a background on a NavigationStack.
